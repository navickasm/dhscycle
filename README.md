## Conventions
Variables named `r` typically refer to a **regular schedule**.

The `h2` field of a special schedule refers to the reason (i.e. Illinois Science Assessment).
This name is derived from the legacy system, where an `<h2>` tag contained this information.

JSON stored in the DB is best practice
